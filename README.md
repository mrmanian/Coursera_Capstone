# Data_Science_Capstone Project  

In this project we will focus on using location data to explore a real world problem by using machine learning and data analysis.  

**Business Problem**  

As this COVID-19 pandemic hit the US back in March, hospitals became jam packed and it came to the point where there were not enough hospitals to take care of all who was sick.  I aim to tackle this issue in this project. Taking into account the number of municipalities, population, income, and number of hospitals, I hope to find out where an addition of new hospitals would be most beneficial in the state of New Jersey.  

**Solution**  

Using k-means clustering, Foursquare API, and linear regression, I explored and clustered the counties in New Jersey to determine any outliers based on the different numerical variables.
